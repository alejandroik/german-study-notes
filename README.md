# German Study Notes

STOMP Subject Time Object Manner Place
the order that sounds most natural is often : Subject verb indirect object direct object and then time. You can also place time between the indirect object
and direct object . Subject verb indirect object time direct object. If you want to emphasize the time then you can change the order to: Time verb subject
indirect object and direct object. There are exceptions , for example if the direct object is a pronoun then it has to go before the indirect object

if there are two objects to a verb (direct and indirect) and both objects are nouns or noun phrases, then the dative object (indirect object) usually
comes first.

-ung ending nouns are always feminine.
-chen (a diminutive ending) and -lein are always neuter gender.

//

acussative pronouns: mich, dich, ihn, sie, es, uns, euch, sie, Sie.

dative object: this could be a dative pronoun (mir, dir, ihm, ihr, ihm, uns, euch, ihnen, Ihnen) or a group of words (e.g. dem Mann, der Frau, dem Kind,
den Eltern).

Temporal object: when the action takes place.

Causal object: why it happens.

Modal object: how the situation happens.

Local object: where it's located.

Accusative object: If the acussative is not a pronoun but a group a words (e.g. den Mann, die Frau, das Kind, die Eltern) it should go after the
"TEKAMOLO" objects.

Durch, für, gegen, ohne, um, über, in, zwischen are prepositions that will always take the accusative.
Aus, außer, bei, mit, nach, von, zu, helfen, danken, seit, gefallen, gegenüber are verbs/words that always take the dative

If "zwischen" describes a position (= where?), it is used with dative. If "zwischen" describes a direction (= where to?), it is used with accusative.
So it is accusative:
Ich setze mich (= I am sitting down) zwischen dich und den Kinderstuhl.
but is dative:
Ich sitze (= I am sitting) zwischen dir und dem Kinderstuhl.

Wir gaben der Eule einen Namen.
-Accusative, mixed N-declension, masculine singular --> einen Namen
-Dative, weak declension, feminine singular --> der Eule

Wo ist mein Onkel gelaufen? Auf der Straße (On the street)
Wohin ist mein Onkel gelaufen? Auf die Straße (Into the street)

Ich lief bis in den Wald / I ran (all the way) into the forest
ich lief im Wald umher / I ran around in the forest

Bis spät in die Nacht / bis spät in der Nacht?

"Bis spät in die Nacht" is derived from "bis spät in die Nacht hinein", which literally translates as "until late into the night". The idea is to describe
a direction (in time) rather than a position in time. And to express directions, you use the accusative case in German

The rule is; By itself, the expression is "spat in der Nacht"; that is a point (location) in time that uses the dative case. But with "bis,"
the construction is "bis spat in die Nacht" (von fruh in der Nacht), which is a direction (in time). That uses the accusative case.

Ich las, bis in der Nacht Maurinus kam.

Upon careless glimpse, this might appear to contradict our elaborations. But in reality it means:

Ich las, bis Maurinus in der Nacht kam.

There is no direction here, Maurinus came at a point in time, so we are back to dative.

## AKKUSATIV

Use AKKUSATIV (WHERE TO?) when there is movement to a new location, Dativ when there is no movement, or the movement is within a location. For example,
Wir springen in das Wasser (we are jumping into the water, Akkusativ) versus Wir schwimmen in dem Wasser (we are swimming in the water, Dativ).
We could also be in the water, jumping up and down: Wir springen in dem Wasser.
In this challenge, we are discussing multiple restaurants, no? Akkusativ would be die Restaurants. But the challenge uses den Restaurants, which is Dativ.
But really, it's simpler than that: mit takes Dativ always.

## AKKUSATIV/DATIVE

Movements in relation to an object leads to accusative (WHERE TO?). No movement in relation to an object leads to DATIVE (WHERE?).
I am running in/into my house. = Ich renne in mein Haus. ~ accusative ~ I change the place from the garden into the house.
I am running in my house. = Ich renne in meinem Haus. ~ dative ~ I am in my house, I am running there, I don't enter nor leave it. ~ no movement in
relation to the house.

ihr = she in the Dative. ihr = you (plural) in the Nomitive.
It depends on whether "she" is the direct object vs. the indirect object of the sentence. For example "I give the book to her" is "Ich gebe ihr das
Buch", but "I love her" is "Ich liebe sie." The accusative case is used for direct objects and the dative case is used for indirect objects. So when
translating from English to German you always have to think about which noun (or pronoun) is the subject vs. the direct object vs. the indirect object
and then select the appropriate case.

---

## NICHT

Usually follows the subject, verb, direct object and all personal pronouns;
Ich kenne deinen Freund nicht. Er sage das nicht. Wir besitzen das Auto nicht. Deine Schwester kennt mich nicht.
Usually follows expressions of definitive time;
Sie können heute Abend nicht kommen. Alex arbeitest jetzt nicht.
Precedes:

- Predicative adjectives (Der Berg ist nicht steil.).
- Predicative nominatives, time and place (Das sit nicht Herr Santa Claus).
- Adverbs of manner, indefinite time, and place (Fred geht nicht zu Fuß. Er besucht mich nicht oft. Wie wohnt nicht hier.).
- Prepositional phrases that show destination (nach Wien), or location (in Bonn); (Sie geht nicht nach Hause. Er arbeitet nicht in Berlin).
- Infinitives complementing modal verbs (Er kann mich nicht sehen).

---

## DICH DIR

"Du" is used in the nominative case, when it is the subject: YOU give the book to the cat.

"Dich is used in the accusative, when it is the direct object: The cat sees YOU.

"Dir" is used in the dative, when it is the indirect object: The cat writes a letter FOR YOU.

---

## BEI/AN

Bei is used to indicate location in or at a particular person's or company's house/locale; it is also used to indicate one's place of work.
If one is working or studying at an academic or otherwise "high-brow" institution, one uses an.

Wir sind bei Hans, wir wohnen bei Inge, ich bin beim Aldi [name of a discount supermarket chain], er ist beim Metzger [=butcher],
du arbeitest bei Siemens/bei der Post/bei Hoechst, sie studiert/lehrt/arbeitet an der Universität.

An [am = an dem] is used quite generally to indicate location at or near a place; bei can also be used and is more like "in the vicinity of."
"an den Strand gehen" if he plans to stay and sunbath there, and "zum Strand gehen" if he just goes there to take a look on the sea without staying there
longer, but in both cases you can say both without actually being wrong

Sie ist am/beim Bahnhof, am/beim Supermarkt, an der/bei der Bibliothek, am/beim Theater
auf on a flat surface (on top of). An on a vertical surface. auf dem Tisch – on the table (horizontal) but an der Wand

"Beim" just means that there is lunch, and there is wine, and they occur at the same time and same place.
"Wir haben beim Essen über sie geredet" (we have talked about her during lunch/ while eating).

"Zum" means they are somehow linked. The wine is part of the lunch or at least served with the lunch.
You can even say "es gibt Steak zum Essen" where the steaks ARE the lunch.
You don't use "zum" when you have an 'adverbial determination of time' like tomorrow, later, soon, etc. Examples: Bis bald! (See you soon!);
Ich werde die Arbeit bis morgen erledigen. (I will finish the work by tomorrow.)
But as soon as you use "bis" + a subject to describe the time, you have to add the preposition "zu" and adapt it to the case (zu + dem = zum;
zu + der = zur). Examples: Bis Übermorgen! (See you the day after tomorrow!); Ich weiß nicht, ob ich bis zur letzten Unterrichtsstunde
durchhalte. (I don't know if i can persevere till the last lesson.)

---

## WER/WEN

WER = It's asking for a nominative object aka the subject (the one who is doing the action).

WEN = It's asking for the accusative object (the one who is directly aimed at with this action)

---

-N

In Dativ Plural, EVERYTHING (article/possessive, adjective, noun) gets an -n at the end

die Freunde > "mit meinen guten Freunden"

Every Dativ plural takes 'n' at end if it doesn't have 'n' already. And for 'den' it is a dativ rule i.e,

'der' changes to 'dem'

'die' to 'der'

'das' to 'dem'

plural 'die' to 'den'

---

## WÄHREND

Preposition that always requires the genitive case.

---

## IHR

It can mean "you" (informal plural); "her" (dative of "she"); "her ...." (possessive of "she"); or "their ..." (possessive of "they").

The first two can be separated from the last two by grammar - "you" and "(to) her" stand by themselves while "her" and "their" will stand before a noun.

They can usually be told apart by verb agreement and case - one is nominative and one is dative, so "ihr = you" will usually be the subject of a verb
which will have the second person plural ending, while "ihr = her" will usually be the indirect object of a verb or the complement of a preposition.

"Her" and "their" can only be told apart from context, much as in English "you" can mean either "you (one person)" or "you (several people)"
and only context will tell you the difference.

---

## GROß/GROßE

If the adjective is in front of a noun, it needs to be declined based on the gender:

der große Fisch / ein großer Fisch (masculine)
das große Haus / ein großes Haus (neutral)
die große Herausforderung / eine große Herausforderung (feminine)
die großen Fische / große Fische (plural, of all genders)
If the adjective is somewhere else, then it is just "groß":

der Fisch/das Haus/die Herausforderung ist groß.

## Das/Dies sind

We use neuter singular forms das or dies to introduce something new to the conversation, regardless of the gender or number of the thing(s) you are
introducing. The verb has to match the number, though -- so you can have das sind... if the things are you introducing are multiple things.

## VERBS

The verb always takes the second position in a sentence
For subordinate clauses the verb comes at the end, for questions and commands it comes first.

---

## WENN

"If he does not come, we do not go."
Translation:Wenn er nicht kommt, gehen wir nicht.

Treat the WHOLE sub clause as ONE item.

The rules for verb placement is that 1) the verb is going to always be the SECOND part of a sentence or 2) for a subordinate clause,
the verb comes last. With that, I'm going to kind of apply PEMDAS (order of operations) here but for grammar. Considering "If he does not come,
we do not go" - Identify the subordinate clause and treat it as ONE item. "(If he does not come), we do not go." Now only do the what's in the
parentheses first. It's a subordinate clause, so the verb will come LAST here: "Wenn er nicht kommt". The entirety of the sub clause could be
considered the 'first item' of the entire statement. The verb from the main clause will be the 'second item' of the whole sentence: "(Wenn er
nicht kommt), gehen wir nicht."

WHOM = "wem" for Dative case/Indirect Object. "wen" for Accusative Case/Direct Object

---

## DENN/WEIL/DA

Denn is like a regular because. Weil is like "for", which can also be used as "because" in English.
Weil has the word order that deviates from what we usually see, so I came with a Yoda-like sentence.

I eat, for hungry I am.
I eat, because I am hungry.

"denn" starts a main clause (coordinating conjunction), which means that the verb comes second:

Ich kann nicht arbeiten, denn ich bin krank.
Ich gehe nicht spazieren, denn es regnet draußen.

Weil often implies a hard-wire and strict connection between cause and effect.
"weil" starts a subordinate clause (subordinating conjunction), which means that the verb comes last:

Ich kann nicht arbeiten, weil ich krank bin.
Ich gehe nicht spazieren, weil es draußen regnet.

you can't start a sentence with "denn", only "weil". So:

Weil ich krank bin, kann ich nicht arbeiten.
Weil es draußen regnet, gehe ich nicht spazieren.

is correct, but you can't start sentences this way with "denn".

You could use "da" instead, however:
Da ich krank bin, kann ich nicht arbeiten.

Da es draußen regnet, gehe ich nicht spazieren.

Da is more explaining the motivation, likely influence, potential cause or a secondary reason.

Most Germans don't over-analyze this and use both words depending on personal preference.

---

## WIESO/WARUM

WIESO, the person is deeply curious or unaware of anything, clueless, for there are less presence of material/tangible subject,
looking for more answers: e.g. "wieso rennst du?" (why are you running?); The person have no idea why he/she was running, either where he/she
from or heading to, if he/she was playing or in danger, of he/she was chasing or being chase by someone, etc etc... in "warum", the person is
looking for a direct answer, also he must have a bit clue or already presupposed that there must be a particular reason of the matter:
e.g. "warum liest du das Buch?" (why are you reading the book?); The person knows what the book is (such as the title and its content), he
just needs to know why he was reading it (the motive).

Wieso is used when asking for purpose/cause. Warum is used when asking for reason/motive.

---

## EINEM/EINER

Einem for masculine dative (e.g. einem Mann, einem Hund, einem Löffel) and neuter dative (e.g. einem Kind, einem Pferd, einem Messer)
but einer for feminine dative (e.g. einer Frau, einer Katze, einer Gabel).
And in the plural, you can have keinen, e.g. keinen Männern/Frauen/Kindern.

---

## NACH/ZU

'nach' - for place names and directions, 'zu' - everything else

zu Hause "at home" describes a location. (Stay home, to be home)
nach Hause "home" describes a direction. (To go/drive home)

ZU makes it dative
NACH makes it dative

nach + dative can only be used in this context (Morgen fahren wir nach Berlin) if the location does not require an article:

nach Berlin
nach Deutschland
nach Amerika
nach Hause

but the second you have an article, you have to use in (+ accusative):

in die Hauptstadt
in die Vereinigten Staaten
in das Haus

Infinitive groups with "zu" are separated by a comma if they depend on a noun ("Begriff" in our case). You can (but don't have to) leave out the comma if
the infinitive group consists only of "zu+verb" and the omission doesn't introduce any ambiguity. So, both
Sie ist im Begriff, zu gehen
Sie ist im Begriff zu gehen
are correct but you need the comma in "Ich bin im Begriff, ein neues Kapitel zu schreiben"

All modal verbs are not followed by zu.
Verbs don't take zu: Dürfen, können, müssen, mögen, sollen, wollen, werden, lassen, sehen, hören, helfen, gehen, bleiben, lernen.

(lernen" can be followed by "zu", it's just often not: er lernt laufen = er lernt zu laufen)

zu + dative implies you are not entering the place. [confirm?]

---

## IHM - IHN

ihm is dative, but ihn is accusative.
ihm = it is the indirect object or following a preposition or verb that takes the dative
ihn = it is the direct object

Ich ersetze ihn

You could say Ruf ihm ein Taxi "Call him a taxi" (i.e. call a taxi for him), for example. Not 'Ruf Ihm' as in "call him"

---

## IN/IM

dative (indicating location, ie it's in the car, WITHIN) = In dem, "Ich schwimme im Meer" - the sea is the "backdrop", if you will, of the motion, but not
the destination of the motion. It talks about a location (walking around inside the Park).

accusative (indicating destination of motion, ie moves it to the car, INTO) = In das. It talks about a direction (into the park)

//

in + Accusative = moved into a location
in + Dative = exists in a location

---

## IN DER/AN DER

In der Grundschule = if they are there as pupils or just in the building for some reason

An der Grundschule = if they work there as teachers.

---

## VON/VOR

Von = describing a distance (if reffering to time and place)
Von meinem Haus bis zum Supermarkt sind es nur 5 Minuten. = I need only 5 minutes from my house to the supermarket.
Ich fahre von Juli bis September auf Urlaub. = I'm on vacation from July until September.

Vor = describing a point (if reffering to time and place)

Ich stehe vor dem Haus. = I'm standing in front of the house.
Ich bin kurz vor meinem Abschluss. = I'm graduating shortly.

---

## VON IHNEN/DAVON

"von ihnen" is used, if you are talking about people or animals.
"davon" is used if you are talking about things

Von requires the dative case.

---

## DO IO

Your point about the pronoun reversing the customary word order is true but only if the direct object is a pronoun. If the indirect object is a pronoun,
then the tendency to put indirect before direct remains in place. Of course, there is that conflicting tendency to put pronouns before nouns but hopefully
Duo won't put students in a position of having to guess which one takes priority in any given sentence.

---

nicht zu ~ cannot
Compare also "Nicht zu glauben!" for "Unbelievable!" -- this also shows the "it cannot be believed" meaning of "nicht zu".

---

## INNEN/DRINNEN AUßEN/DRAUßEN

außen and innen- inside and outside of an object. Draußen and drinnen- indoors and outdoors.

Basically außen means “on the outside, on the outer surface”, whereas draußen means “not within”.

---

## VERPASSE/FEHLT

Ich verpasse meinen Zug / I am missing my train" - I am later and I will miss the departure of my train

"Mir fehlt ein Zug / I am missing a train" - I am actually missing my train that I own as an object, like its gone and I must search for it.
///// CONJUGAR COMO V. "FALTAR"

---

## GEHÖRE

"Ich gehöre zu ihm" says e.g. I have come together with him, am part of his group etc.
"Ich gehöre ihm" means I am his slave. He bought me.

---

## MAL

Mal is a "modal particle" that is included to add flavour to a sentence, rather as English would add similar fillers like this: Well, let's see;
OK, let's see; Well then, let's see. It does not contain any particular semantic significance, apart from padding, softening or temporising, usually
to allow the speaker to gather his thoughts.

---

## NOUN

"Du kennst den Bären nicht."
Bear is a weak noun in German, which means it takes the -N declension rule. For every instance where Bär is not the subject, it adds -en to the end.
Den Bären, dem Bären, des Bären. It happens with words like Student, Junge, Präsident, and Löwe. The vast majority of them are masculine, with a few
neuter ones like Herz.
http://germanforenglishspeakers.com/nouns/weak-nouns-the-n-declension/

## WEAK NOUNS

Masculine nouns ending in short -e are usually weak nouns. To demonstrate what we have learnt in the short exposition, let us go with masculine,
accusative, dative and genitive forms side by side. Singular, then plural. Our animate noun (which is usually a person or an animal) here will be
der Junge (the boy). Our inanimate noun will be der Name (the name).

Der Junge, den Jungen, dem Jungen, des Jungen Der Name, den Namen, dem Namen, des Namens
Die Jungen, die Jungen, den Jungen, der Jungen Die Namen, die Namen, den Namen, der Namen

Masculine nouns that end in -e are almost always weak. The only notable exceptions are der Käse and the ones ending with ee like der See, der Schnee,
der Kaffee and der Tee and some foreign nouns that don't pronounce the -e, like der Service and der Store.

Firstly, der Käse. There is nothing special about this noun, it just declenses as any other would. Der Käse, den Käse, dem Käse, des Käses.
Plural always Käse. Some French loans ending in mute -e, such as der Service, will also follow under this classification, but this should be
self-evident from the mere fact this letter is not even pronounced. In a similar way, nouns ending in long [e], such as der See (the sea) are not
expected to be weak either.

Secondly, the odd noun "das Herz", as odd as the feelings we usually associate to it. In the same way weak masculine nouns did, this neuter noun
will get a genitive singular -ens and a uniformal plural -en. In the same fashion the "das" article does not change in the accusative form, though,
neither does "Herz". There is, however, a problem with the logical dative singular form, "dem Herzen". So weird was that irregularity that spoken German
ended up making it "dem Herz", as a regular noun. The usage "dem Herzen", however, survives both in formal use of language and in expressions
such as "Operation am offenen Herzen" ("open-heart surgery") or "vom Herzen" (wholeheartedly). The declension for this noun is, therefore...

Das Herz, das Herz, dem Herz/Herzen, des Herzens
Die Herzen, die Herzen, den Herzen, der Herzen

Among those that were borrowed, sometimes we can recognise them from their suffixes, such as -ist (der Gitarrist, der Kommunist),
-at (der Diplomat, der Soldat), -nt (der Elefant, der Präsident). Some others, such as der Architekt or der Pilot, should just be picked up,
either by long, boring lists, or by simply absorbing it out of usage. An example:

Der Gitarrist, den Gitarristen, dem Gitarristen, des Gitarristen
Die Gitarristen, die Gitarristen, den Gitarristen, der Gitarristen

Masculine nouns with Latin (or Greek) endings (especially referring to people or professions) are weak. This one is a bit more confusing since one may not
know what a Latin ending is, but I assure you that after some getting-used-to, you'll be able to tell easily.
Examples:

der Doktorand (doctorand), der Praktikant (intern), der Automat (vending machine), der Assistent (assistant),der Obelisk (obelisk), der Astronaut (astronaut)
der Athlet (athlete), der Vagabund (vagabond), der Ökonom (economist), der Philosoph (philosopher), der Fotograf (photographer), der Chirurg (surgeon)
der Monarch (monarch), der Soldat (soldier), der Kamarad (comrade), der Architekt (architect), der Idiot (idiot), der Rebell (rebel), der Satellit (satellite)

An important thing to be reminded of is that, although some of those foreign words do refer to inanimate beings, those do not receive -ens
in their genitive plural form. See, for instance, the declension of der Satellit:

Der Satellit, den Satelliten, dem Satelliten, des Satelliten
Die Satelliten, die Satelliten, den Satelliten, der Satelliten

Then, we have some exceptions that don't really fit into either category, but are weak anyway. Many nouns in this category have a tendency to be strong in
casual speech as I will point out in the examples.

## Examples:

der Ahn (ancestor; strong and weak both standard), der Bär (bear; only weak is standard; colloquially often strong), der Bauer (farmer; only weak is standard;
colloquially often strong), der Bayer (Bavarian), der Depp (dork; strong and weak both standard), der Fink (finch; only weak is standard; colloquially
mostly strong), der Fürst (sovereign prince), der Geck (dandy), der Graf (count), der Greif (griffin; strong and weak both standard), der Held (hero),
der Herr (gentleman), der Hirt (herdsman), der Leopard (leopard; strong and weak both standard; genitive is weak), der Leu (lion), der Magyar (Magyar),
der Mensch (human; only weak is standard; colloquially often strong), der Mohr (blackamoor), der Nachbar (neighbour; strong and weak both standard;
colloquially often strong), der Narr (jester), der Oberst (colonel; strong and weak both standard), der Prinz (prince; only weak is standard; colloquially
often strong), der Schenk (cupbearer), der Spatz (sparrow; strong and weak both standard; colloquially mostly strong), der Tor (fool), der Typ (guy/type;
when meaning type, declension is never weak; when meaning guy, declension is sometimes weak (strong is just as common)), der Tyrann (tyrant),
der Ungar (Hungarian), der Untertan (subject; strong and weak both standard), der Vorfahr (forebear), der Zar (tsar; only weak is standard; colloquially
often strong)
and so forth... (these are most of them (including all common ones), but yes, there are indeed more exceptions. If I were you, I wouldn't concern myself
very much - most of them are often treated as strong, anyway)

A small handful of inanimate weak nouns with an -e ending takes -ns in the genitive singular instead of simply -n. Like so:

Nominative: der Name - die Namen
Accusative: den Namen - die Namen
Dative: dem Namen - den Namen
Genitive: des Namens - der Namen

## Examples:

der Buchstabe (letter), der Name (name), der Gedanke (thought), der Same (seed), der Friede (peace), der Wille (will), der Funke (spark), der Glaube (belief)

Note that many of these nouns are "strengthening" in that their nominative singulars are taking on the -n suffix as well. For example, der Frieden is now more
common than der Friede. Even der Bogen (bow) was once weak, but has now fully strengthened. The days of this group may be numbered.

Let us start with common nouns which are always weak: der Herr (the gentleman, sir), der Held (the hero) and der Tyrann (the tyrant).
We will start with der Herr to demonstrate a common feature that, after the sound of [r], [e] might be dropped off a following suffix.
Usually, this rule does not apply to the plural form of Herr, which makes it a pretty irregular word.

Der Herr, den Herrn, dem Herrn, des Herrn Der Held, den Helden, dem Helden, des Helden Der Tyrann, den Tyrannen, dem Tyrannen, des Tyrannen
Die Herren, der Herren, den Herren, der Herren Die Helden, die Helden, den Helden, der Helden Die Tyrannen, die Tyrannen, den Tyrannen, der Tyrannen

Some nouns, however, exist both in strong and weak forms. Those usually have their weak declension as a formal use, with their strong declension
tending towards colloquial language. Sometimes, though, both are acceptable in formal language. We will use two examples here:
der Mensch (the man; which is weak, but sometimes goes mistakenly strong in informal language) and der Nachbar (the neighbour; which is
formally acceptable both in weak and strong forms).

Der Mensch, den Menschen, dem Menschen, des Menschen
Der Mensch, den Mensch, dem Mensch, des Menches... this is WRONG
Die Menschen, die Menschen, den Menschen, der Menschen

Der Nachbar, den Nachbarn, dem Nachbarn, des Nachbarn
Der Nachbar, den Nachbar, dem Nachbar, des Nachbars... this is okay, too
Die Nachbarn, die Nachbarn, den Nachbarn, der Nachbarn

---

## WIE/WAS

wie" = "how" and "was" = "what". In this case confusion arises because we tend to think in terms of English language. It is just that in English we use
"what" for asking someone's name but in German we use "wie":
Formal: Wie ist Ihr Name? Wie heißen Sie?
Infromal: Wie ist dein Name? Wie heißt du?

"wie" is also used to inquire about someone's telephone number or address:

Wie ist Ihr Telefonnummer ?
Wie ist Ihr Adresse ?

Wie compares two things of the same "status". since you're comparing "deine Freunde", which is the subject and therefore nominative, you have to use the same
form for the pronoun refering to the group of people talking:

Sind deine Freunde genauso schüchtern wie wir?

---

## ADJECTIVES

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_declension#Attributive_adjectives

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_adjectives#Mixed_inflection

Weak inflection - Das rote Pferd.
Strong inflection - Rotes Pferd.
Mixed inflection - Ein rotes Pferd.

Weak inflection is used after definite articles (the), dies- (this), jen- (that), jed- (every), manch- (some), welch- (which), alle (all), beide (both)
and maybe a few others.

What do I have? I have a brown hat. > Was habe ich? Ich habe einen braunen Hut
ein brauner Hut, der braune Hut, einen braunen Hut, den braunen Hut.

Simple rule: when the determiner (here "der") is not in its nominative form (it would be "die" for feminine), the adjectives following it take the
"-(e)n" ending:

"Ich habe einen braunen Hut" = 'I have a brown hat';

"Du spielst mit deinem kleinen blauen Spielzeug" = 'You are playing with your little blue toy';

"Das sind die Eltern meiner schönen Frau" = 'Those are my beautiful wife's parents'.

"The good friends know us."

The endings of attributive adjectives, i.e.adjectives before nouns such as "the good friends", "a black cat", or "red wine" depend on three factors:

1. Type of article before the noun: der-words (=weak inflection), ein-words (=mixed inflection), or unpreceded (=strong inflection)

2. Case of the noun (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative)

3. Gender/Number of the noun (masculine, feminine, neuter OR plural)

I.e. here, the noun "Freunde" is:

1. used with a der-word (= weak inflection)

2. nominative (because it's the subject of the sentence)

3. plural

Based on these three factors (weak inflection, nominative, plural), the adjective "gut" gets the ending "-en".

When speaking in the superlative (The highest degree of 'Good, better, best'), in German, we are saying what is at the best. "Am", hopefully we all
know by now, is a contraction between "An" and "Dem". Because "an" is a dual preposition, this means that "Der/Dem" (Or if neuter, "Das") can be in the
dative or the accusative case.

For more info on dual prepositions: http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa052101a.htm

Now, because one is at the highest or greatest (this uses the superlative), we say "am" instead of "an dem". In this translation, Duo is saying one is at
the highest/best, so because he is already there, we use dative.

Therefore, we say "am" when referring to somebody being at the highest position for any adjective.

For more info on adjective degrees (Positive, comparative, superlative) http://www.infoplease.com/cig/grammar-style/three-degrees-separation.html

```
EDIT: This idea is applied to all adjectives when speaking in the superlative, not just an individual at the highest/greatest/whatever superlative
adjective you use. This idea is applied when anything is at the greatest that that thing/idea can be at. It is weird when directly translated into english,
so you should probably not think of "am liebesten" as "at the most gladness (That I can be)".
```

High is hoch. When followed by nouns, it would be hohe(before feminine/plural), hoher(before masculine), hohes( before neuter), and hohen
(before accusative masculine). Here it would be hohe tische, but since it's preceded by "die" and the noun is plural, it's hohen. Höher means
taller/higher. Since Höher is preceded by "die" and the noun is plural, -en is added to the adjective and it becomes höheren. Otherwise when followed by
a verb, höher would be höhere (feminine/plural), höherer(masculine), höheres(neuter), and höheren(accusative masculine).

"der höhere Berg" - the taller mountain
"höheres Buch" - higher book
"höherer Vogel" - taller bird
"ich mag den hohen Vogel nicht" - I don't like the tall bird.

Individuell = usually about character or personality, about aspects that are unique about someone
Einzeln = simply means individual in the sense of not a group/separate

f you only have adjectives (e.g. ich habe viele große leckere Kekse "I have many big [and] tasty cookies"), but as soon as you have a determiner before
the adjectives that has the -e ending, they switch to -en -- for example, meine vielen großen leckeren Kekse or die vielen großen leckeren Kekse.

## IMPERATIVE

Iss und trink - informal singular

esst und trinkt - informal plural

essen Sie und trinken Sie - formal singular and plural

---

"eher", "ziemlich" or "ganz" for "rather".

They are mostly interchangeable. A rule of thumb is to use Ziemlich when you'd use pretty (as in "The building is pretty tall" = "Das Gebäude ist
ziemlich hoch"),
ganz for quite: "The car is quite old" = "Das Auto ist ganz alt", and eher for rather, as seen in the phrase Duo suggested.

zuständig = legally/professional//in charge
verantwortlich = morally/common/personal

echt/wirklich echt is more like "genuine" and wirklich is like "true". interchangeables.

-Ziemlich- -
Mein Hunger ist ziemlich starker. ("My hunger is rather strong. ", truly means "quite, rather" ) Er spricht ziemlich gut Englisch. ("He speaks fairly
good English.", but also "pretty, fairly")

-Tatsächlich- -
Ich habe tatsächlich keinen Hunger. ("I'm actually not hungry.", means "factual, actual, real". We use tatsächlich for things that are 100% true.)

-Eigentlich- -
Ich habe eigentlich keinen Hunger. ("I'm actually not hungry.", means "can be real or not". Use eigentlich for things with a certainly under 99.9%.
In other words, "I lie, ok? I am hungry!")
//  
always learned that "eigentlich" is more of a correcting word like:
A: Tomatoes are vegetables
B: Tomatoes are actually (eigentlich) fruits.

-Wirklich- -
Mein Hunger ist nicht wirklich. ("My hunger is not really." - would mean, "real, really". Really is really! Wirklich ist really!)

The first sentence is saying "If you bring the waves into your field of vision, you will see a shark.", whereas the second sentence is requiring you to
really look at the waves, to take in their beauty.

---

## DA

Da-prepositions are used as placeholders for something said previously. In english, this would be like:
I had a pen. It is missing. ("It" here is the placeholder)

In German, you'd have:
Ich habe einen Termin morgen. Ich denke daran - I have an appointment tomorrow. I am thinking of the fact that I have an appointment.
(Ich denke von ihm would be wrong here.)

However, there is an exception, for living beings. If you had to say:
Ich habe einen Hund zu Haus. Ich denke von ihm. - I have a dog at home. I am thinking of him.
(Can't use daran here.)

More examples:
Haben wir eine grüne Tasche? Ich kann mich nicht daran erinnern - Do we have a green bag? I can't remember if we have one.
Bis dahin, wird er das Fahrrad reparieren. - By then, he will fix the bike.
Er arbeitet nur, weil er dafür gut bezahlt wurde. - He only works because he is paid well for it. (In response to someone asking - "Why does he work if
he doesn't like it?"

-

It's also a placeholder for things immediately to follow, which is unlike english. This happens a lot with verbs that attach with prepositions.
For instance, warten is to wait, but AUF etwas warten is to wait FOR something. If that something is a person or thing, then it's simple, just put it
in the accusative: Ich warte auf dich -- I'm waiting for you. Ich warte auf den Bus -- I'm waiting on the bus. BUT! If that something is a sentence
with a verb, then you can't just put auf in front of it:

I am waiting for the bus to come -- Ich warte auf den Bus zu kommen IS WRONG!

You'd need to use this sort of anticipatory da-word, that points to the sentence to come, pointing forward, rather than back:

Ich warte darauf, dass der Bus kommt. -- I'm waiting for the bus to come.

---

## KENNEN/WISSEN

Kennen = to know (a person).

Wissen = to know (information).

---

## ACHTEN

Würden = Would you.

Hätte = Would have (if have is used as a full verb)

---

## KEINERLEI/ÜBERHAUPT

'Keinerlei dieser Hüte' is wrong. If you want to express 'none at all' in this sentence, you could use 'Ich mag überhaupt keinen dieser Hüte'. 'Keinerlei'
implies that you are speaking about an unspecified set of hats, which contradicts the 'dieser'. Technically, 'ich mag keinerlei Hüte' would work.
don't use 'keinerlei' for concrete objects very often. It's more appropriate for abstract nouns like: 'keinerlei Anstrengungen' (no efforts at all) or
'keinerlei Verständnis' (no understanding at all). I wouldn't bother too much about this word since it's usually fine to use 'keine/keiner/keines' instead.

---

## BEREIT/FERTIG/SOWEIT

Bereit can mean "willing" "unreluctant", as in "are you prepared to die for your country?". Fertig would be wrong there.

Fertig is more like finished (preparing). like "das Essen ist fertig". Usually means done/finished, ocassionally ready.

Soweit is about a progression, about a stage you're at: Sie wollte schon eine Familie gruenden, aber er war noch nicht soweit. Usually means ready,
rarely done. Not formal.

---

## ALLERDINGS/ABER

Allerdings" is an adverb, whereas "aber" is (almost always) a conjunction. So the former occupies a "syntactic slot" in a sentence, whereas the latter
doesn't. Furthermore, "allerdings" can also mean "definitely, of course, certainly".

---

Gleich = now, very soon

## MINDESTENS/WENIGSTENS/ZUMINDEST

If used as "as much or more than", mindestens (Quantifier) is preferred:
Du brauchst mindestens 30 Punkte — You need at least 30 points.

But when it's not about numbers, wenigstens (or its synonym immerhin) is preferred:
Wenigstens sind wir noch am Leben — At least we're still alive.

Ich habe mindestens 3 Euro. = I have at least 3 Euro.
Ich habe wenigstens 3 Euro. = At least I have 3 Euro.
Ich habe zumindest 3 Euro. = Well... at least I have 3 Euro.

Mindestens = The actual, precise idea of mindestens is “at least this much and possibly more”. Think of minimum wage (Mindestlohn). It’s the minimum,
but there are plenty jobs that pay more. Mindestens looks beyond the boundary it defines. It suggests more. And that’s why it works perfectly with all
kinds of numbers or other “measures”.

Das dauert mindestens 3 Stunden. = That’ll take at least 3 hours.
Ich bleibe mindestens bis Freitag. = I’ll stay till at least Friday.
Ich werde mindestens bis Berlin fahren, vielleicht auch weiter. = I’ll drive at least to Berlin, maybe farther.

Wenigstens = Comes from whining, isn’t as “optimistic” as mindestens. That is to say, it does not reach for more. Kind of looks the other way and sees
that it could have been less. So the actual idea is this: “good thing I at least have this”. Wenigstens does work with numbers and measures too, though
not to the same effect as mindestens, but more often it is used to color the statement as a whole.

Wenigstens muss ich morgen nicht arbeiten. = At least I don’t have to work.

You could say that after you elaborated why tomorrow will be a shitty day. Maybe you have to go to the dentist. Or ballet. Or both. But at least no work.

Du gehst ja wenigstens ab und zu laufen. Ich mach gar keinen Sport. = At least you go running from time to time. I don’t do ANY sports.

// Bleib mindestens bis Freitag! = Stay till at least Friday!
// Bleib wenigstens bis Freitag. = At least stay till Friday.

// The first one is a rather blunt command to stay till Friday, or longer. The second one is more of a plea… like…
// “Come on… stay till Friday, you’ve only been here for such a short time, whine whine whine.”

Zumindest = And that does neither of what the others do. It doesn’t imply more nor isn’t particularly whiny or relieved. It kind of just acknowledges
what is there. So, I’d say the actual idea is like this “THIS at least is for sure. As for more, I don’t know.”

Das ist der beste Burgerladen, den ich kenne… zumindest in Friedrichshain. = That is the best burger joint that I know… at least in Friedrichshain.
Du kannst ohne Training nicht einfach einen Marathon laufen… oder zumindest nicht ohne Pause. = You cannot run a marathon without training.. or at
least not without breaks.

It introduces a limitation to a statement. And it kind of between the lines tells us that I was inclined to make a more general statement but then I
just reduced it to the part I am really sure of. Neither mindestens nor wenigstens can do that. Mindestens would be totally out of place with its
constant hinting at more. And wenigstens… well… it’s a little whiny… like… “Come one agree with me. At least with that limitation you have to agree
with me”. Zumindest is just like... that’s my statement. I limited it, but at least this is what I’m sure of.

If I use zumindest in place of one of the others.

Ich habe zumindest 3 Euro. = Well... at least I do have 3 Euro.

Not as “relieved” as wenigstens and not as “maybe even more” as mindestens.

Now, are there ever situations when they are interchangeable? Yes. Especially in wishes and complaints.

Du hättest ja wenigstens/mindestens/zumindest mal anrufen können. = You could have at least called.

Short version:

Mindestens has a bit of “or more” attached to it and it is mostly used with measures of any kind. The most stereotypical sentence is this:
I have at least 10.

Wenigstens is glad that it’s not less and in questions and orders it can sound a bit begging (not in a negative way).
A very typical sentence is this:
At least I have ten.

Zumindest is pretty neutral and just states what is there. It is mostly used in combinations with limitations to statements that were a bit… too general.
A very typical sentence is this:

This and that is so and so… at least under this condition.

This is a classic if someone is late. And they all work. The difference is just tone. Wenigstens is somewhat “nag nag nag”, mindestens sounds
slightly pissed (as it suggests I could have done more than just call) and zumindest is… just firm ( like “You’re late. Could have called!”)

Super short version:

Wenigstens is when you "whine" with pessimistic/optimistic or hopeful statements.

Mindestens is when you state that it could be more.

Zu mindest is when you say, at least form my point of view, at least in my opinion, ...from what I know.

---

## JEDENFALLS/TROTZDEM

---

## ZIMMER/RAUM

Zimmer = Room in a house/building
Raum = Space, spatial

---

## ZUM/BIS ZUM

Bis zum: This is somehow an end, the person that led you there leaves or stops leading or something. Its until you reach the estimation Bahnhof and
then the action ends or something else changes.
Zum: A more neutral way and would be used if the person leads you someWHERE else afterwards AND also when its just to the Bahnhof, then both could be
used, but this does not transport the information that then the action ends.

//

You don't use "zum" when you have an 'adverbial determination of time' like tomorrow, later, soon, etc. Examples: Bis bald! (See you soon!);
Ich werde die Arbeit bis morgen erledigen. (I will finish the work by tomorrow.)
Used when talking about destination.

But as soon as you use "bis" + a subject to describe the time, you have to add the preposition "zu" and adapt it to the case (zu + dem = zum;
zu + der = zur). Examples: Bis Übermorgen! (See you the day after tomorrow!); Ich weiß nicht, ob ich bis zur letzten Unterrichtsstunde durchhalte.
(I don't know if i can persevere till the last lesson.)

---

## HIN/HER

Hin = Away from the speaker

Her = towards the speaker.

## HINAUS/HERAUS

Hinaus means you have a point of view inside a location and you watch something moving out of it (like you are in a house and go out).
Heraus means your point of view is outside of the location, and you watch something coming out.

Ie.So now you have your stain or whatever in a cloth. Since you are not inside the cloth with the stain, you have to use "heraus". As for the verb part,
the important thing is not that the stain comes to a new location, but that it leaves its current location, so you use gehen (to leave).

Rein/Raus are shortened versions from Herein/Heraus, but for most speakers they no longer have the "her" connotation and are used simply for "inside"
and "outside", regardless of where the speaker is.
So rein can stand for either hinein or herein, and raus for either hinaus or heraus.

Miteinander means conjointly, together, side by side, literally "einer mit dem andern" (one with the other) and highlights the relationship and
cooperation between people. It's also the opposite of gegeneinander. PURE ADVERB (ie Wir sind miteinander/Wir haben miteinander gegessen are wrong).

## FLAVORING PARTICLES

https://coerll.utexas.edu/gg/gr/mis_04.html

Aber: Intensifies what is being said, may also express surprise.
Kinder! Das ist ABER eine Überraschung! = Children! WHAT a surprise!
Usually used to combine sentences which are contradictory at first sight, especially when one sentence states osmething seemingly bad and the other doesn't.

Also: Means 'well ...' or 'so ...' at the beginning of sentences. Not the same as 'also' in English (which is auch in German)
ALSO liebe Kinder, wie findet ihr mein Häuschen? Lecker, oder? = WELL, dear children, how do you like my little house? Tasty, isn't it?
Ja, es schmeckt sehr gut, danke. = Yes, it tastes very good, thank you.
Haha! Ich bekomme ALSO DOCH Kinder mit dieser schlauen Falle! = Haha! SO I can get children with this clever trap AFTER ALL!

Auch: Used to confirm information.
Möchtet ihr reinkommen und was zu essen haben? Wenn nicht, ist's ja AUCH egal. = Would you like to come in and get something to eat? If not, it doesn't REALLY matter.
Seid ihr AUCH sicher, dass ihr nicht reinkommen wollt? = Are you REALLY sure you don't want to come in?

Denn: Only used in questions, either to make them sound more casual or to express heightened or diminished surprise, interest, or urgency.
Was meinst du DENN, Hänsel? Sie kann nicht gefährlich sein, oder? = So, what do you think, Hänsel? She can't be dangerous, can she?
Hast du DENN deinen Verstand verloren?! Wir kennen sie nicht! = Have you lost your mind?! We don't know her!

Doch: Conveys surprise, disbelief, or a sense of impatience. May also emphasize validity. Most important function is to give an affirmative answer to a
question or statement containing a negation.
Das stimmt. Aber Fremde wie sie können sicher nicht gefährlich sein. = That's true. But strangers like her can't possibly be dangerous.
DOCH, sie könnten! = YES, they could!
Eben: Expresses resignation or resigned acceptance. May also mean just, now, or then. As a one-word answer, it means 'exactly (what I said)'.
Hänsel, wieso könnte sie gefährlich sein? Sie ist steinalt - älter als unsere Großeltern! = Hänsel, how could she be dangerous? She is ancient - older than our grandparents!
Das ist es EBEN! Hexen sind steinalt! = That's EXACTLY it! Witches are ancient!
Sie ist EBEN NUR eine alte Dame, die Kinder liebt. = She is JUST an old woman who loves children.
Mostly interchangeable with Halt.
States something that is contrary to the way you want it to be, but you can't change it and have to accept it anyway. Puts a resigned emphasis on the sentence.
So ist das Leben eben = That's how life is, can't change it.
Dann müssen wir halt den anderen weg nehmen = Well, then we have to use the otehr way [if this one is blocked], even if we don't want to.
It's used to emphasise your [in your opinion correct] statement or argument. Standard language often prefers to combine Eben with drum/darum. Can be used as Genau (Deshalb) too.
Eben darum/genau deshalb müssen wir die Armut bekämpfen = That's exactly why we have to fight poverty!.

Eigentlich: Used in questions and statements to soften the tone or express genuine curiosity. May also mean actually. In conversations, it functions
as a discourse marker that introduces a change of topic.

EIGENTLICH, gnädige Frau, kommen wir gerne herein! = ACTUALLY, ma'am, we would love to come in!

Mostly interchangeable with Eben.

in combination with wohl. Idiomatic expressions:
Das wäre ja gelacht! = (Expresses certainty that something will succeed)
Das ist ja wohl die Höhe! = That's outrageous!
Sie wissen ja, wie das ist. = Well, you know how it is (assuming it's obvious)
Ihr müsst JA verhungert sein! Setzt euch an den Tisch, und ich bereite das Essen vor. = You two must be starving! Sit down at the table, and I'll prepare the meal.

Mal: Softens the tone of questions and statements, conveying casualness like the English particles just, real quick, and hey. Mal itself is never stressed within the sentence
Sag MAL, mein lieber Junge, möchtest du noch was zu essen? Du hast nicht viel gegessen. = SAY, my dear boy, would you like something else to eat? You didn't eat much.
Nein, danke. Ich habe mich satt gegessen. = No, thank you. I've eaten my fill.
Red keinen Quatsch! Probier MAL die Knödel. = Don't talk nonsense! Try the dumplings ONCE.

Was dauert NUR so lange? Magst du das Essen nicht? Du sollst NUR nicht denken, du könntest es einfach verderben lassen! = What (ON EARTH) is taking so long? Don't you like the food? You'd BETTER not think you can just let it go to waste!
Iss NUR, Hänsel. Es macht ältere Leute froh, wenn man eine zweite Portion nimmt. = JUST eat, Hänsel. It makes elderly people happy when you take a second helping.
Also used to belittle something and emphasize that something's not as bad or as hard as it seems.

Schon: As an adverb, it means already. In combination with mal, schon means ever or ever before (The negative counterpart to schon mal is noch nie).
Gnädige Frau, ich habe SCHON zwei Portionen gegessen. Dies wäre meine dritte! = Ma'am, I've ALREADY eaten two helpings. This would be my third!
Liebe Schwester, habe ich mich SCHON MAL geirrt? = Dear sister, have I EVER been mistaken?
Nein, NOCH NIE. = No, NEVER.
schon = already, yet
As a particle, it may be used affirmatively to signal confidence.
Hänsel Nur keine Sorge, Gretel. Wir werden SCHON entkommen. = Don't worry, Gretel. (I'M SURE) we'll escape.
As a particle, it may also be used to express urgency or impatience.
Jetzt komm SCHON, Hänsel! Dein Käfig wartet auf dich! = Now come already, Hänsel! Your cage is awaiting you!
In certain cases, it can be used interchangeably with wohl, signaling that although something is certainly true (a concession), there is also
another perspective.
Ihr entkommt mir nicht - ihr seid nur Kinder! = You'll never escape from me - you're just children!
Das SCHON, aber wir sind sehr intelligente und erfinderische Kinder! = That's CERTAINLY TRUE, but we're very intelligent and resourceful children!
Finally, it can also express resignation (like eben, halt, nun mal).
Was kannst du SCHON machen, wenn du in diesem Käfig bist? = What can you do if you're in this cage?
Ich habe das Gerät noch nicht geladen. Ich habe das Gerät schon geladen.

noch = still
"Hast du das Gerät noch geladen?" would be something like "Did you still manage to get around to charging the device (before we left)?"

Total: A fashionable flavoring particle among German teenagers, just like English totally.
Diese Hexe ist TOTAL blind! Anstatt meines Fingers strecke ich ihr immer ein Knöchlein heraus! =This witch is TOTALLY blind! Instead of my finger, I always extend a little bone!

Überhaupt: Two main functions; 1. Emphasizes that something is generally the case, 2. Signals finality in the sense of (not) at all.
Nach vier Wochen ist Hänsel ÜBERHAUPT nicht dicker geworden! Gretel, hol das Wasser - ich kann nicht länger auf mein Essen warten. = After four weeks Hänsel has not become fatter AT ALL! Gretel, fetch the water - I can't wait any longer for my meal.
ÜBERHAUPT nicht, du scheußliche Hexe! = ABSOLUTELY NOT, you horrid witch!

Wohl: Two main functions; 1. Expresses probability (even certainty), 2. Signals concession to a previously made point (like schon).
Wie komme ich da hinein? Ich weiß es nicht. = How do I get in there? I don't know how.
Dumme Gans! Du siehst WOHL, die Öffnung ist groß genug! Kinder heutzutage ....sie sind so verwöhnt! = (You) stupid goose! You can CERTAINLY see that the opening is big enough. Children these days ... they are so spoiled!
Das WOHL, aber mein Bruder und ich sind anders als die typischen Kinder! (Gretel gibt der Hexe einen Stoß und sie fällt in den Ofen hinein.) Haha, wir haben dich getäuscht! = That's TRUE, but my brother and I are different than the average children! (Gretel gives the witch a push and she falls into the oven.) Haha, we fooled you!

Zwar: Means to be sure or it's true. Is often followed by a counter-argument introduced with aber.
Hänsel, dieses Märchen war einfach zu grausam. = Hänsel, this fairy tale was just too brutal.
Du hast Recht. Es war ZWAR grausam, aber es hat auch Spaß gemacht! Guck mal, wieviel Gold wir jetzt haben! = You're right. IT'S TRUE it was brutal, but it was fun, too! Look at how much gold we have now!

## PAST

non-emphasized prefixes (ver-, ent-, be-, zer-, er-, …): A) don't split off ("ich kaufe ein" vs "ich verkaufe"), and B) won't get a "ge-" as participle II.

Whenever the action has something to do with moving (from A to B or similar) or a change of state, you probably need "sein".
Examples of the moving sort:
fahren, gehen, kommen, laufen, treten, schwimmen

The change of state sort:
werden, einschlafen, aufwachen, wachsen, sterben, explodieren

The ones that don't really fit the rules:
sein, bleiben, begegnen, passieren, geschehen

-ieren verbs have -iert endings in Perfekt
